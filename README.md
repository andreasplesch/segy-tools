# segy-tools

Seismic data in SEG-Y format often requires inspecting files before processing with targeted software. It is convenient to use standard unix tools such as dd or od for this purpose since these tools are typically available on any system without installation procedures. This repo collects small examples or shell scripts to quickly inspect any SEG-Y file or extract trace data.
